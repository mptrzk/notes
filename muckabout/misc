fibs generator in lisp
my own looping macro
implementing coroutines


I don't like the 

generic @ but quicker

static typing


make it like js object?
  nth skips keywords


everything seems clunky
lisp seems bloated
  well, the code is shorter, too bad it doesn't work
    it wouldn't have worked in js either
    assigning to a var doesn't mutate stuff it points at

macro alias

getf

setf places

make notes in proper way

learn all the functions/macros

destructuring structured lambda lists
  flatten
