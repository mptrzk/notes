my algorithm
  for each param:
    perturb param up, if better, apply
  for each param:
    perturb param down, if better: apply

optimizer should only take integer bound for each parameter and the cost function

gen one series, have function that generates bounds based on that series

explain the rounding trick


culling stupid combinations
    like 1M + 1p
  iterate up to a relative tolerance
