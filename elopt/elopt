minimize
  f error
  q error
  wasted power

my algorithm
  for each param:
    perturb param up, if better, apply
  for each param:
    perturb param down, if better: apply

optimizer should only take integer bound for each parameter and the cost function

gen one series, have function that generates bounds based on that series

explain the rounding trick
