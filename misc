de-smartassizing my setup
  replace all the clunky bullshit with stuff that's actually good
  the software should just run

making copy & paste sane in vim
  system clipboard being the "*" buffer seems sensible
    neovim?
  move away from vim?

vim tab labels are unhelpful now
  call note files the same way you call projects

new kreck paradigm
 ((op . payload) . args)
 why?
  to not hardwire inop semantics


notetaking
  project/project
    yay
      vim tabs are meaningful
    nay
      looks silly

practicing writing readmes
  preview markdown

learn vscode?
