all this windows all over the place
  I don't want the repl window to be opened alongside the debugger window

maybe first figure out how to put everything on the right side of a vsplit

let's just go along the tutor, we will figure out other stuff later

check out those slimv bindings

the debug command
  let g:vlime_compiler_policy = {"DEBUG": 3}
  can I specify it in lisp?
    I remember doing something like that
  is this command buffer specific?
    "g:" means global supposedly

what's that fasl stuff all about
