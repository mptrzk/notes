single promise functonaroo

promise semaphores?


state machine
  
storing last answer in the model

side effect way
  qs & pt is async
  
bidirectional communication with a generator

generator that yields a promise and waits

normal generator, answers stored somewhere in the model
  so that generator can use it


  
when it's one "draw", you can just call it from anywhere

"draw" as an argument makes view functions more ?explicit?

but that's the limitation I'm willing to break
  rly?
  draw is always the same here
    but that isn't obvious when looking at the API



the art of practicing bad practices



make the answers editable

the sorting should reset
resetting cache

make it just yield nothing


preact
  does memo prevent vdom diffing in higher order hooks?
    doe

deletion and sorting progress

it yields after asking

bug afterthoughts
  wrong pivot in hoare partition qs
    test stuff
      write stuff so it can be tested easily

hacking it to use standard sort?`
