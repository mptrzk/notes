why is pickle sync so slow
why is foo['bar'] = baz fast

cache

syncing periodically

maybe it caches it in the file

re-read page rank

ranking heuristics within the result and the whole index


inverted index as just a set

use a debugger

lazy datastructures & filtering

site filter

jsons is stupid
  badly named
  slow

regular dicts & efficiency
  regular - same keys in collections
  structlike


fidx = [doc]
  doc = [word]
  word = (name, [pos])

bidx = [(word, docs)]

queued shelf write?

todo
  prepare simple frontend
  figure out concurrent db access
  rewrite the crawler
