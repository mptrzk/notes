;BUGS

weird freeze
	that was 429

==================================================
;FEATURES

language
custom timeout
custom blacklist/whitelist
chceck if site is blocked
request removal from blacklist
throttling
captchas
tokens for feedback


==================================================
;UI



footer
	status
	blocked
	timed out
	blocked new

sending blocked overhead
	
"moar" outside of results div?
	
	

result html on client side?

==================================================
;REFACTOR

moving stuff to client's side
	why?
		to simplify the server's side
		to make the server side capable of serving multiple users without storing session-specific state
		to make the server compute less
		to let the client do other stuff with the results than displaying it

bbb?

permanent state
	what?
		express app
		websocket server
		browser
		blocker
		blacklist
	what to do?
		class?
		globals?

pull the synchronous stuff out of (async) closure

==================================================
;PUPPETEER ENGINE

puppeteer

async for non-function blocks?
	just use a lambda

blocker event returning page
	to avoid cross-capture
		which is when event that should be assigned to one url, gets listened by another
	check how webext updates per page ad count

filtering a list of ulrs
	map using a function that:
		takes url, browser and blocker handles


ddg html
	submit button with puppeteer


timeout?
many pages at once?

getting at least n legit results
	load serp
	filter


getting 429d by the unpopular search engine

==================================================
;NODEJS

package
license
commonjs kerfuffle

==================================================
;COMM

description of behavior
	server sends the static page
	client sends the query
	server begins generating results
	server sends either:
		a legit result
		"end of page"
		"end of search"

server actions:
	result
	end of page
	end of search
	^^through ws?

client actions:
	search
	moar
	^^ through http??

^^just communication?

"if got a restult, request one more"

calling search function from connection event, with socket arg


queue entries:
	result
	end of page
	end of search

if queue is empty, wait
	event?
	promise?

locking?

websockets?



static stuff
	
express stuff
	static
	res.send twice?
	event emitter

factor out the search loop

==================================================
;UNCATEGORIZED


simple filter

get results from google api
crawl in
discard those that
	display popups
	display shit that doesn't scroll
		unless it's nav or something
	display ads
		basically anything which would trigger an ad block
		list of ad servers
	autoplay media
	asks for notifications?
display result, but with the true URL
