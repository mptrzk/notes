pseudo-parser?
string representation

symp & stack overflow
	not using maptree?
		dedicated function that maps over sexps & handles errors

deflist sanely
	function to do it all in bulk
		doesn't quite cut it
	it's just an alist, duh

"scope" parser macro
	

what let does
	takes
		as args:
			bindings, which consist of
				names
				expression
		from env:
			deflist, innermost binding slot
	appends

you have to strip parser macros before running them...
do they have a separate deflist for stripping?
	too complicated too fast?
