set up vsmth
  n-root version?

global thingamajiggles problem
can't call draw from global event handlers
  can bind new event handlers on each render
    does it make stuff slow?

explicit check for handler initialization?
it's the same draw() after all, can bind it
seems finnicky though
a workaround for something that would be trivial in version with one global draw()
but does it really matter? normal event handlers get rebound on each rendering as well
document element isn't special


array of freqs for all midi notes
create and attach oscs on key_down
what about creating oscs? 
are unattached oscs slow?
you'd have to re-initialize them each time you change waveform
are they passively slow though?

does MIDI signal release and stop separately?


but I want to mix final notes, not sum oscilators
  rly?
  does it matter?

MIDI notes are weird

tidy up keydown & keypress

ignore autorepeat using flags for each key

many oscillators with the same tone should be able to play at once
  shouldn't be a problem, killing the osc can be deferred

filter synced to the note

fm
  varying parameters with periodic wave

using the same patch many times
typable knob readings


why is it so stateful
maybe filters need it?
do I need to create the whole pipeline for each note?

a simple filter stores one sample

I want the signal for each midi note to be processed separately, so I can make the filter offset based on the note
physical synths probably don't do it like that
  rly?

small polyphony

note list-queue
or just array
expired notes get overwritten on insert
  why not while playing?
    additional branch?
    adding a zero is quicker than checking if there's anything to add
      but what if it defragmented the note array? it would loop less from that sample on

how timeouts work?

setValueAtTime in the future?
  that's what it's for probably

what can be done with allpass?

a hacky phase shift extension for osc 
the OOP way
just for lulz

velocity dependent piano key coloring

knob problem
  write fn with explicit side effect?
  same with read function
eliminate the param

when side effect gets farther and farther away from the root view, it gets messier and messier

  128 voices?

write a synth with worklets?

do orphaned webaudio nodes get GCd?


why doesn't the compressor attenuate a single note?
yeet the compressor?

voice gain
  better to do at the mixning node, so the knob turning takes the effect while the note is playing

voices
  as many voices as notes
    that number isn't special, 
    initializing all the voice circuits isn't a problem
    not iterating through mute notes during playback
  limited
  reinitialize each time

how to stop webaudio from computing a disconnected circuit?
  maybe it doesn't compute them?
    what about delay lines?

non-deterministic release?

voice allocation

"""
Don't use oscillator.stop(now). Use oscillator.stop(osc1ReleaseVal) to schedule the oscillator to
stop at the same time as the gain goes to 0.

You don't have to disconnect and delete the oscillators. Once stopped, the oscillator can disconnect
itself from the gain node by itself. If you drop the reference to the oscillator, it can be garbage
collected.

"""
  rewrite noteoff
  how disconnecting works?
    can I get that info?
  how about delay nodes?

"delete" vs setting as "undefined"

stopping a voice below an amplitude threshold
  for k-s

karplus-strong
  seems impractical to have 128 delay lines
  12 delay lines?
    works with TET

how are guitar frets spaced?

adding noise waveform


abstracting a wave shape selection view
  abstracting a "selectable" thingy?

is putting a note table into synth a good thing?

some all-note mapping must be inside synth, so the correct note gets released

voice as a data structure
  all the WA nodes
  note name field kinda doesn't fit
    petty

keyboardable component
  call it a synth?
    naaah
      synths should be separated
        they could play in the background
      it's just a midi input
    maybe, but I might want MIDI splitters later
  MIDI receiver
  it can press a note or release it

fooboard octaves
  fooboard view as a method?
    spurious instantiation?
      I want fooboards other than synths
        like the splittable one
        it's just a wrapper, bro
        but a stateful wrapper
  fooboards won't change destinations
  but they may change octaves

the oop-functional clash

the view also doesnt' change, it could be preinitialized

more VMish way would be to store all fooboard octaves separately

doing it with classes seems bloated

using call
  synth object has fns using "this"
  the fooboard thingy binds them
^^ forgot how methods in old js work

knob in MV with selector

p(r_min) = p_min
p(r_max) = p_max

linear version:
  p(r) = ar + b
  a*r_min + b = p_min 
  a*r_max + b = p_max
  a(r_max - r_min) = p_max - p_min
  a = (p_max - p-min)/(r_max - r_min)
  b = p_min - a*r_min

logarithmic version
  p(r) = a^r <- wrong, but why?
  p(r) = c^(a*r + b)
  p_min = c^(a*r_min + b)
  p_max = c^(a*r_max + b)
  lc(p_min) = a*r_min + b
  lc(p_max) = a*r_max + b

is c a free parameter?
I don't think so
  desmos gives the same curves for c=e & c=10

are all exponential curves scaled versions of one another
  .A a, b .in R+: .E c in R+: .A x: a^x = cb^x?
they aren't, lol
  but how to prove it?
    prove that c is not a constant function of x
scaled in which way?
  does it matter?

vv is that horizontal scaling?

what i meant is:
  a^x = b^(cx) ?
  a^x = (b^c)^x
  x = log_a((b^c)^x)
  x = x*log_a(b^c)
  log_a(b^c) = 1
  b^c = a
  c = log_b(a)
or 
  log_b(a^x) = cx
  x*log_b(a) = cx
  c = log_b(a)
^^ why didn't I think of the 2nd one 1st?

inverse of a linear function is also a linear function
  y = ax+b
  x = (y-b)/a
    = y*1/a - b/a
^^ how to wrap it up formally?

why are linear transformations called linear?

why would I not want them in knobs?
